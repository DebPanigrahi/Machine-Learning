    "There is already a lot of coverage on this topic on the internet, but some skip the math due to wide audience, others just complicate it using complex mathematical notations and words. Inorder to drive the NN one may not care whats under the hood, but to do more than that you may need to know whats under the hood (sometimes down to the components) without the jargons. Below I derive some basic math to compute the updates needed for back-propagation. The notations are influenced by fast.ai (Deep Learning) program at USF and Deep Learning specialization course in Coursera. Hope you find it helpful. Afterall the functions are linear with few more variables, how hard can it get? All we need is familiarity with neural network and high-school math. \n",

    "Forward propagation is nothing but applying a series of functions on an input vector $X$ with resulting output of each is also a vector. For a neural network generating a logical output between 0 and 1 with 1 hidden layer the function can be represented as $\\sigma(f_2(g_1(f_1(X)))$. More generally for a network with $L-1$ hidden layers; $g_L(f_L(...g_l(f_l(..f_1(X)..))...))$. And activation at layer $l$ can be represented as $A_l = g_l(f_l(A_{l-1}))$ assuming its a linear layer followed by a non-linear activation function. Chain rule states that the derivative of $g_l$ with respect to $A_{l-1}$ can be represented as a function of derivative of $g_l$ with respect to $f_l$:  $ \\frac{\\partial g_l }{\\partial A_{l-1}} = \\frac{\\partial f_l }{\\partial A_{l-1}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial g_l }{\\partial f_l}$. And we say error $\\frac{\\partial g_l }{\\partial f_l}$ in layer $l$ is now \"back-propagated\" to layer $l-1$.\n",

    "Below is a neural network with 2 adjacent (linear+activation) layers $l-1$ and $l$ with $m$ and $n$ nurons respectively. Then the forward propagation through linear layer is $Z_l=W_l\\cdot A_{l-1}+B_l$ ; where $W_l$ is an $n\\times m$ dimensional weight matrix mapping a $m$ dimensional vector $A_{l-1}$ to $n$ dimensional vector $Z_l$ with bias $B_l$.

    "To minimize cost by doing backward propagation we need to first adjust $A_L$ in the last layer in the direction of decreasing cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ : $A_L = A_L-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{C} }{\\partial A_L}$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive \"learning rate\". Since $A_L$ can be a vector (for example in multi-label classifications) $dA_L=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{C} }{\\partial A_L}$ has the same dimension as $A_L$ as it can change in as many ways as the number of elements in $A_L$. $dA_L$ can be propagated backwards through activation layers and linear layers. Then we calculate the error in the cost function with respect to each of the parameters (weights/biases) and inputs to a given layer (which are outputs of previous layer). Now we can try to find generic equations for backward propagation through activation layer in layer $l$ using chain rule. The trick is to keep it simple and not apply chain rule until we break the equation into smallest dimension possible. \n",
